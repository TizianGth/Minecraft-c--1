# Minecraft c++1
 
My first project in c++ to help me lern OpenGL

What I have done so far:
- Inputs
- Simple camera "Spectator mode"
- Asynchronous infinite chunk generation with perlin noise
- Little things like a custom grass shader for changing the grass color like in the origianl Minecraft or fog
