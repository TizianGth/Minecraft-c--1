# Minecraft c++1
 
My first project in c++ to help me lern c++ and computer graphics.

What I have done so far:
- Inputs
- Simple camera "Spectator mode"
- Asynchronous infinite chunk generation with perlin noise
- Some minor things like fog

Currently working on:
- Physics, mostly collisions right now
